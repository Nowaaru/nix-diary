## Dear, Diary...

A repository for my Nix shenanigans.
Need a to-do because I keep forgetting
what I was on about.

Order is priority.

### Personalization

- [ ] Neatly implement file associations
      for users individually.

- [ ] Create Gecko-based browser option-set module because
      the home-manager configuration doesn't work.

- [ ] Configure neovim-flake dashboard.

- [ ] Make a neovim .desktop file, or maybe
      just use gVim?

- [ ] Implement custom icon for floorp using
      home-manager.

- [ ] Implement `wlsunset`-based nightlight widget
      using [`eww`](elkowar/eww).

- [ ] Implement an actually-competent audio device
      widget using [`eww`](elkowar/eww)

- [ ] Look into Yabar

  - Thanks, dub. üëç

- [ ] Implement kernel-based virtual machine
      via system configuration.

  - Will definitely share the flake file when it's complete üòç

- [x] Install video editor

  - Kdenlive will probably do.

- [x] Install [neovim-flake](https://github.om/NotAShelf/neovim-flake)

- [x] Install Rojo.

  - Need this for Roblox development. Probably.

- [x] Implement custom user management
      through home-manager.

- [x] Configure neovim flake.

### System

- [ ] Implement a clipboard manager using [`eww`](elkowar/eww)
      and [`cliphist`](sentriz/cliphist).

- [ ] Implement a screen recording solution.

  - 'Nuff said. Might look into asciinema for
    terminal solutions and gpu-screen-recorder
    for desktop.

- [x] Extract theming system into a different
      flake.

      - [x] Settled by storing into .config file.

- [x] Personalize Waybar (or just use Eww)

  - Ended up sticking with Eww because waybar has
    layering problems and doesn't play well with follow-mouse
    on hyprland. Siiiigh.
