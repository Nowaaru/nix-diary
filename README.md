Dear, Diary...

A repository for my Nix shenanigans.
Need a to-do because I keep forgetting
what I was on about.

- [ ] (CURRENT) Manage LazyVim plugins.
  - Dropped the idea to manage this purely from Nix
  because the documentation regarding Neovim's options are
  about as present as my father.
  Probably the most likely reason for me to not
  touch this repo for a few months.

- [ ] Add window rules to enable tearing on full-screen
applications.
  - Turns out that tearing with double buffering is a feat
  that Linux doesn't like. Seems like it's a "deal with it and 
  wait" problem.

- [ ] Fix Roblox Studio + Wayland mouse acceleration problem.
  - Supposedly "fixed" in Wine 9.0-rc2, but Vinegar uses a patched
  Wine 9.0-rc1. Could just up and yoink the patches from the source but
  laziness is a vice.
